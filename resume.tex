\section*{Summary}
Embedded linux expert and open source contributor.\\

Very good knowledge of the complete software stack - experience ranging from low-level, real-time
operating systems, through the linux kernel to user-space programs, libraries and distributions.\\

Experienced in interacting with hardware (board bring-up, writing device drivers, general kernel
space development).\\

Worked on international projects in a broad range of fields: bleeding edge consumer electronics,
high availability systems and military applications. Both on-site as well as remotely.\\

Significant contributions to many open-source projects - especially in the embedded applications.
Experienced in working with the open-source community.\\

Using C for low-level development, C++, python and bash/sh for high-level use cases.\\

Speaker at several international conferences.\\

Maintainer of libgpiod - C library and tools for accessing the GPIO character device on linux.\\
