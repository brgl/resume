\\&
\textbf{Key Projects:}\\&
\underline{Internal Operating System version 6:}\\&
Embedded operating system based on the \textbf{2.6.X/3.X Linux kernel}
series designed for ARM devices:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ported the Linux kernel to a new \textbf{ARM} board based on the
	Freescale i.MX53 processor – this includes setting up various
	devices, configuration of the IO multiplexer and adaptation of
	some of the system code,
	\item implemented changes in the u-boot bootloader, expanded
	u-boot internal \textbf{i.MX I2C driver}, added additional functionalities
	to the booting code,
	\item expanded the \textbf{AT24} Linux \textbf{EEPROM} driver, by adding new
	functionalities end extended sysfs interface, implemented
	the \textbf{Power Managment System} – a C++ application designed to maintain
	low power consumption by managing suspension of the system,
	controlling and powering various peripheral devices and interacting
	with board's \textbf{PMIC},
	\item developed and supported a library of C++ classes commonly
	used by most of the applications running in IOSv6, including
	system logger, configuration files parsers, simple \textbf{socket}
	interface etc.,
	\item developed and supported a library of C++ classes providing an
	interface between C++ and Python code, allowing easy
	\textbf{embedding of Python scripts} inside C++ applications.
\end{itemize}
\\&
\underline{Internal Operating System version 4:}\\&
Older embedded operating system based on the \textbf{2.4 Linux} series and
running mostly on military \textbf{VoIP} and phone exchange systems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item implemented a new version of the internal software watchdog
	and system manager for IOSv4 – C++ daemon meant to be fully
	configurable and robust,
	\item implemented the \textbf{Voice Recording System} for VoIP and radio
	transmissions, expanded the functionality of the \textbf{ESD sound
	daemon} and developed an application retrieving data from the
	sound server and storing it (including its metadata) as .ogg files
	in a distributed environment,
	\item developed and implemented a distributed configuration system
	for \textbf{VoIP terminals} and \textbf{radio gateways} allowing configuration of these
	devices using various means of data transmission (\textbf{Ethernet, CAN, RS-232} etc.),
	\item backported \textbf{Winbond 83627H/HF watchdog driver} to 2.4 kernel,
	\item developed and implemented an interface (written in C++) between
	user and \textbf{Sendmail} daemon, allowing for easy configuration of mail
	services by translating user XML input to Sendmail configuration syntax,
	\item implemented a set of Bash scripts for the \textbf{Remote Update System}.
\end{itemize}
\\&
\underline{Vehicle Information Interface:}\\&
Java Web-service based application providing information about
various parameters of military vehicles to the \textbf{BMS} (Battlefield
Managment System):
\begin{itemize}
	\item  implemented crucial low-level routines in \textbf{C} and wrapped them
	in Java classes using \textbf{Java Native Interface}.
\end{itemize}
